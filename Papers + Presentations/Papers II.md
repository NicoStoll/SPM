### Project Organization
- Problems of Software Development: Excessive Bug Count, Performance, Stability, Hasty Staffing, ...
- Responsibility Assignment Matrix:
	- **Responsible:** assign direct responsibility to individuals
	- **Accountable:** Supervision of assignments in alignment with requirements
	- **Consult:** Provide input and feedback on project tasks
	- **Informed:** Stakeholders kept up to date

### Project Teams
- team size: bigger = increased productivity, decreased quality and performance
- effective teams communicate openly and facilitate information sharing, and have strong team work skills
- multicultural teams need to have channels for conflict resolution

### Project Manager/Style Influence
- **Transformational Leadership:** inspires and motivates, promotes creativity, fosters a shared vision --> increased team motivation, creativity and collaboration
- **Transactional Leadership:** structural approach, clear goals, performance monitoring --> ensures task completion
- **Democratic Leadership:** encourages team participation, fosters collaboration --> better decision-making and team motivation
- **context matters for choosing a approach**

### Project Quality Management (QM)
- Quality (ISO): the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements
- Project Quality Criteria:
	- **Accuracy:** deliverables are consistent with stakeholders expectations
	- **Completeness:** features have been established and implemented
	- **Timeliness:** finish within the stipulated timeframe
	- **Consistency:** dependability of output and processes throughout the project lifecycle
	- ...
- Agile QM emphasizes continual improvements and customer collaboration, encourage client participation, 

### Project Phases/Stages
Mapping Phases:

| SDLC                          | Waterfall              | Incremental            | Agile                       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Requirement Analysis          | Requirement Analysis   | Communication          | Iteration Planning          |
| Planning                      | Planning               | Planning               | Iteration Planning          |
| Design Implementation Testing | Modeling Construction  | Modeling Construction  | Iterative Execution         |
| Deployment Maintenance        | Deployment Maintenance | Deployment Maintenance | Iteration Review & Feedback |


### Project Generation/Initiation
**Initiation:** project formally defined, authorized and launched, identify the key people involved, establish measurable objectives, define purpose
- Documents generated in Start-up:
	- outlined business case for the projects
	- project approach and scope
	- plan for the Initiation Stage


### Managing Small Projects
- **strategic planning
- **resource optimization**
- **risk management**
- **agile** methodologies can help improve efficiency

### Managing Megaprojects
- Challenges:
	- **Scale and Complexity**
	- **Long Duration**
	- **Interest Coordination**
	- **Interdisciplinary nature**
- Success Factors:
	- **Effective Leadership and Governance**
	- **Stakeholder Engagement**
	- **Resource Allocation and Management**
	- **Risk Management**
- critical obstacles such as scope management, cost overruns and timetable delay must be addressed proactively

### Managing Public Sector Projects
- **Influences:** Regulations, Bureaucracy, Politics, Private firms, institutional complexities (delays, national and geopolitics)
- **Multi-party project alliance framework**
	- **Pro:** able to meet demands of external and internal teams, quick resolution of institutional complexities
	- **Cons:** Vulnerability of public owners and public entities, external demands prioritized, inefficiencies in stakeholder management

### Managing Maintenance Projects
 **Adaptive Maintenance:** modifying and updating a software system to ensure it continues to operate correctly in a changing environment. This type of maintenance addresses changes in the softwareâ€™s operational environment, such as updates to the operating system, new hardware, changes in business processes, or regulatory requirements.
**Preventive Maintenance:** making changes and improvements to a software system to prevent future problems. It aims to identify and fix potential issues before they become significant problems, thereby improving system reliability and reducing the likelihood of unexpected failures.
**Perfective Maintenance:** enhancing software functionality to achieve objectives such as reducing system usage costs and improving maintainability
**Corrective Maintenance:** Fix defects and bugs in the software
**Maintenance effort estimation**: aid PM in estimation of maintenance effort, utilized function point (FP) model for estimating effort

#Complexity #Trust #Failure #Success #Stakeholder #Change #Trust #Transparency
### Project Environment
- **internal:** within the organization
- **external:** outside the boundaries of the organization
- Analysis via:
	- **PESTLE**: external (political, economic, social, technological, environmental, legal)
	- **SWOT:** internal strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats
- each project is **unique**, select appropriate methodologies for each project

### Complexity
- stems from **relations** and **interactions** between elements in the system, makes the project difficult to understand, **multifaceted**
- **4 dimensions** of complexity:
	- structural: size and variety of components within a project
	- dynamic: changing project environment, fluctuating requirements
	- organizational: interactions between different stakeholders, departments, ...
	- other: uncertainty, ...
- some complexity (e.g. technological complexity) **increases performance** while most don't

### Project Success


### Project Failure
- failure can be on the side of either one of the two 'owners':
	- **client:** delay, cost overrun, doesn't match requirements
	- **supplier:** cancelled, cause for delay in other projects
- 90-700% increased cost, turnover, ...

### Project Management and Trust
- vital for project success --> fosters collaborative, innovative and results-oriented environment
- Building Trust in Agile Teams: **Transparency** (visibility in project backlog), **Shared Ownership** of project, **Psychological Safety** (Team is comfortable sharing ideas), **Regular Team Meetings**, **Retrospective Sessions**, **Knowledge Sharing**, **Celebrate Success Together**
- Manage conflicts effectively with early intervention and open communication
- Build trust with stakeholders through regular **communication** and **managing expectations**
- Challenges to Trust: **Unrealistic expectations**, **unclear roles**, **poor communication**, **focus on velocity over quality**

### Contract and Location constellation influence
- Inter-organizational projects (IOP) are cooperative endeavors with several organizations cooperating to achieve a shared objective (e.g. Research and Innovation Projects, Join Ventures and Strategic Alliances, Infrastructure and Construction Projects, ...)
- **Contract:** must cover obligations of each involved entity, funding, provision for quality control, coordination processes, ...
- **Conflict Management:** join steering committees or conflict resolution provisions, proactive communication, frequent feedback, oversight committee, collaborative decision making processes, ...
- **Agile:** SAFe, XP

### Project Stakeholder Management
- **Stakeholder:** anybody who stands to win/lose from the result of the project
- **Principles:** collaborate, examine all stakeholders issues, customize procedures based on stakeholders abilities, share profits and liabilities of activities
- **Process:**
	- **Identify** stakeholders, split in groups according  to expectations
	- **Record of Stakeholders** contains all info on kay stakeholders
	- **Analyze** stakeholders priorities, influence and interest, map individuals who can impact the project (e.g. Interest Map, Influence Map, Impact Map)
	- **Plan & Execute**: determine requirements, provide roadmap for successfully engaging with stakeholders
	- **Stakeholder Engagement** continuous process during project's entire lifecycle

### Managing Change
= process of regulating and managing change in the project development process
- software project have **dynamic environments** necessitating adaptability 
- **Challenges:** resistance to change, uncertainty/ambiguity, scope creep, cultural barriers, ...
- **Change request** (submitted by stakeholders) --> **Requirement analysis** (PM analyzes implications) --> **Change Log** (centralized record of change requests)
- **Process:**
	- **DEFINE** the plan
	- **COMMUNICATE** the vision
	- **DETAIL** --> translate into a reality
	- **IMPLEMENT** 
	- **ENSURE** expected results have been achieved

### Project Transparency
= state in which information is easily accessible, understood and auditable
- Transparence builds **Trust, Accountability, Risk Mitigation, Collaboration**
- Implementation:
	- **Clear Goals and Objectives:** define project scope, objectives and deliverables upfront with stakeholders
	- **Open Communication Channels:** Regular meetings, daily stand-ups and retrospective sessions.
	- **Transparent Decision-Making:** involve stakeholders in key decisions, provide visibility into decision making process


### Maturity Model Comparison
- organizations strengths and weaknesses can be evaluated by using maturity models like **CMMI, OPM3, PMMM, Kerzner's PMMM and P3M3**
- Maturity Levels:
	- Level 1 (Initial): Process unpredictable, poorly controlled and reactive
	- Level 2 (Managed): Process characterized for Projects and is often reactive
	- Level 3 (Defined): Process characterized for Org. and is proactive
	- Level 4 (Quantitively managed): Process measured and controlled
	- Level 5 (OP): Optimization-Focus on process inprovement

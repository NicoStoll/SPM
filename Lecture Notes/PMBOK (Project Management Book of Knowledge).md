### Project Documents:

1. **Project Charter**: Formally authorizes the project, contains project objectives
2. **Project Scope Statement**: States what work should be accomplished and what deliverables need to be produced
3. **Project Management Plan**: States how the work will be performed

### SMART:
- Specific: Objectives must be precise and defined unmistakably)
- Measurable: Both quantity and quality
- Attainable: Objectives must be challenging and pretentious
- Realistic: Objectives must be achievable
- Time and resource constrained: Start and end dates, milestones


### Project Lifecycle:

### Knowledge Area Scope Management:

**Product  Scope** = Features and functions that characterize a product or service
**Project  Scope** = The work that must be done to deliver a product with the specified features and functions, also what is OUT of scope

### Risk Management

#### Risk Management Artifacts

**Risk Register:**
- **Description:** A document containing a list of identified risks, their characteristics, and the results of the risk analysis and risk response planning.
- **Structure:** Typically includes risks defined in terms of CAUSE, EVENT, and EFFECT/IMPACT, with PROBABILITY as an optional attribute.
  - **Cause:** The source or reason for the risk.
  - **Event:** The risk occurrence or condition.
  - **Effect/Impact:** The consequences if the risk occurs.
  - **Probability:** The likelihood of the risk occurring.
- **Potential Responses:** Planned actions to address each risk.

**Prioritized Risk List:**
- **Description:** A ranking of risks based on their significance, typically considering both their probability and impact.
- **Purpose:** Helps in focusing on the most critical risks first.

**Risk Indicators:**
- **Description:** Metrics or signals that suggest when a risk might occur.
- **Purpose:** Provide early warning signs for proactive risk management.

**Response Strategies:**
- **Description:** Defined approaches to handle risks, categorized into strategies for threats and opportunities.
  - **Threats:** Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept.
  - **Opportunities:** Exploit, Share, Enhance, Accept.

**Residual & Secondary Risks:**
- **Residual Risks:** Risks that remain after implementing risk responses.
- **Secondary Risks:** New risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response.

**Contingency/Fallback Plans & Contingency Reserves:**
- **Contingency Plans:** Predefined actions to be taken if identified risks occur.
- **Fallback Plans:** Alternative actions if contingency plans fail.
- **Contingency Reserves:** Budget or time reserves allocated for addressing risks.

**Risk Owners:**
- **Description:** Individuals responsible for monitoring and managing specific risks.
- **Purpose:** Ensures accountability and ownership for risk management activities.

#### Risk Management Process

PMBOK outlines a structured process for managing project risks, consisting of the following steps:

**1. Plan Risk Management:**
- Develop the risk management plan, which defines how to conduct risk management activities for the project.

**2. Identify Risks:**
- Identify and document risks that might affect the projectâ€™s objectives.
- Techniques: Brainstorming, Delphi technique, SWOT analysis, checklists.

**3. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis:**
- Assess the priority of risks using their probability of occurrence and impact on project objectives.
- Tools: Probability and impact matrix, risk data quality assessment.

**4. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis:**
- Numerically analyze the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives.
- Tools: Simulation (e.g., Monte Carlo), decision tree analysis.

**5. Plan Risk Responses:**
- Develop options and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to project objectives.
- Response strategies are planned for both threats and opportunities.

**6. Monitor Risks:**
- Track identified risks, monitor residual risks, identify new risks, and evaluate risk process effectiveness throughout the project.
- Regularly review and update the risk register and risk management plan.

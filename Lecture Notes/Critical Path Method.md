#CriticalPathMethod
### Terminology:
- **Critical Path:** the chain of activities along which the delay of any activity will delay the project
- **Early Start Time (EST):** the earliest that an activity could possibly start, given precedence relations
- **Late Start Time (LST:** the latest an activity could possibly start without delaying the project
- **Early Finish Time (EFT):** the earliest, that an activity could possibly finish
- **Late Finish Time (LFT):** the latest an activity could possibly finish without delaying the project
- **Activity Slack:** the amount of "play" in the timing of an activity **slack = time buffer --> LST-EST = LST-EFT**

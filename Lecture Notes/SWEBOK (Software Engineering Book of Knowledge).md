The knowledge is divided into knowledge areas forming a common ground of best practices in the industry. Following list is incomplete:

- Software requirements
	- Requirements Process
	- Requirements Analysis
	- Requirements Validation
- Software Design
	- Software Design Fundamentals
	- Software Structure and Architecture
- **Software Construction (Example):**
	- Software Construction Fundamentals
		- Minimizing Complexity (create simple & readable code, make use of standards)
		- Anticipating Change 
		- Constructing for Validation
	- Managing Construction
		- Construction Models (waterfall, spiral, V-model, RUP, XP)
		- Construction Planning (defining the order in which components are created and integrated)
		- Construction Measurement (code complexity, code inspection statistics, fault-fix and fault-find rates)
	- Practical Considerations
		- Construction Design (real-world problem addressed by the software)
		- Construction Language (configuration languages, toolkit languages, programming languages)
		- Coding (source code organization, use of classes, ... , handling error conditions, prevention of code-level security breaches, resource usage, code documentation, code tuning)
		- Construction Testing (unit + integration testing)
		- Reuse (selection of reusable units, databases, test procedures or test data)
		- Construction Quality ( test-first development, debugging and code stepping, use of assertions, static analysis)
		- Integration
- Software Testing
	- Test Levels
	- Test Techniques
	- Test Processes

**Software Maintenance:**

Issues:
1. Technical issues (Limited understanding, testing, impact analysis)
2. Management issues (alignment with organizational objectives, processes, outsourcing)
3. Maintenance cost estimation (cost estimation, parametric models, experience)

### Milestones

Are used for visible status for all members of the project and reporting to the management and customers. Milestone dates are **set in advance**, define **start and end of project activities**, are used to detect project **delays** and **review** the project progress.

The reporting periods are entered on the **X-axis** and the milestone dates on the **Y-axis**. If the corresponding points are connected to each other, the result is a line, which shows the progress.

### Interpretation

#### milestones on time

#### 80% syndrome, as deadline approaches

#### forced deadline by subsequent milestone

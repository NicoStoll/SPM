#Estimation #PlanningPoker
### Requirements
- traceable
- based on quantitative figures from the past
- estimates done by those responsible to carry out the respective task in the course of the project
- document all estimates (explanations, risks, ...)


### Estimation Methods

#### analogy

#####  Multiplication methods: linear correlation between 2 figures (e.g. LoC - person days)

##### Percentage method
Assigning effort proportional to project phases based on previous projects. Estimates for any new project: 'forecast' - based on estimating one or more phases of that project AND based on any phases that have already been accomplished
#### expert methods

##### Delphi method

The Delphi method is a structured approach used in project management to gather and consolidate expert opinions anonymously. Experts independently provide estimates or judgments in multiple rounds, which are aggregated and summarized to identify trends and patterns. Feedback from each round allows experts to revise their estimates, aiming for convergence towards a consensus. This method reduces biases that can arise from interpersonal dynamics and ensures a diverse range of perspectives are considered. Ultimately, the Delphi method produces a final estimation or prediction based on the collective judgment of the expert panel, aiding in project planning and decision-making processes.

##### informal expert estimations

##### Three point estimates
three estimates are taken into account
- optimistic (ideal)
- realistic (most probable)
- pessimistic (worst case)

This method requires **huge effort**. Estimates are averaged according to PERT: 
**(optimal + 4 * realistic + pessimistic) / 6**

#### further advanced methods

##### Constructive Cost Model CoCoMo
“COCOMO II is a model that allows one to estimate the cost, effort, and schedule when planning a new software development activity. It consists of three submodels, each one offering increased fidelity the further along one is in the project planning and design process. Listed in increasing fidelity, these sub models are called the Applications Composition, Early Design, and Post-architecture models.”
##### Function Point

#### Agile Estimation - Planning Poker

Each player (developer) has a hand of planning poker/blank note cards.
- Cards contain numbers fine grained low, coarse grained large numbers (e.g0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, infinity)
- Customer (a.k.a. Product Owner) reads a story.
Process similar to Delphi Method: until estimates converge
- Developers discuss to make sure they understand the story, not how they would build it.
- Each secretly chooses their estimate for the relative effort (no times).
- All expose their estimate simultaneously.
 - Discuss extremes, re-deal if needed.
No need to discuss how, if all give the same estimate
→ Allows faster estimation.


### Common Problems:

- too optimistic
- inherently insecure
- benefit from experience, but project bear novelty by definition
- team members with individual backgrounds

### Questions

#### Explain how Agile emphasizes direct customer collaboration and why this is important for project success.

<details> <summary>Click to show answer</summary> <p>Agile promotes direct customer collaboration to ensure that the development team understands and meets the customer's needs effectively. This direct interaction helps in clarifying requirements, gathering feedback early, and ensuring that the delivered product aligns closely with customer expectations.</p> </details>

#### Compare and contrast Agile's approach of 'small hierarchies and managers as enablers' with traditional project management structures. How does Agile's approach contribute to faster decision-making and team empowerment?

<details> <summary>Click to show answer</summary> <p>Agile promotes small hierarchies where managers act as enablers rather than authoritative figures. This allows teams to make quicker decisions, promotes empowerment among team members, and fosters a collaborative environment where issues are resolved swiftly at the team level, contributing to faster project progress and adaptation to changes.</p> </details>

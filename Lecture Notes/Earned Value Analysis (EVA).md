#EarnedValueAnalysis #EVA
### Basic figures

#### Planned Value (PV):
= planned cost of the total amount of work scheduled to be performed calculated for each task that is represented in the schedule

$$\int\left(PV_{K}\right)$$

#### Actual Cost (AC):
= cost incurred to accomplish the work that has been done to date

#### Earned Value (EV):
= the value of work that has been achieved to date

$$EV=\int PV_{k}\cdot DegreeOfCompletion$$
### Derived figures

#### Cost Variance (CV):
= compares actual cost to the budgeted costs

$$CV=EV-AC$$

#### Cost Performance Index (CPI):
= compares budget with actual cost

$$CPI=\frac{EV}{AC}$$
#### Schedule Variance (SV):
=compares planned work to completed work

$$SV=EV-PV$$

#### Schedule Performance Index (SPI):
= compares the budget with the plan

$$SPI=\frac{EV}{PV}$$

#### Critical Ratio (CR):
$$CR=SPI\cdot CPI$$

### Forecast

#### Estimated Cost (EAC):

$$EAC=AC+\frac{Budget_{rem}}{CR}=AC+\frac{Budget_{rem}}{CPI\cdot SPI}$$

#ProjectStart
### Activities:

- Preliminary study (feasibility study)
- Define project objectives
- Define project **scope** and **content** with client
- rough **estimation**
- rough **project planning**
- establishing the project
	- fixing project procedures and organization
	- team building
	- define **project goals** (involvement of all stakeholders)
	- **kick-off and workshops**

### Project Definition Contents:

- project **motivation** (business objectives)
- **project objectives**
	- quantitative objectives in the triangle
- project and product results
- project strategy (planned procedures, time and budget plan, milestones)
- project stakeholders (**identify all affected people**)
- project organization
- project team
- duties of the client
- assumptions, opportunities and risks
### Requirement Analysis

= systematic process, using iterative and cooperative analysis to figure out requirements
- e.g. use case methodology
- **goal:** check problem understanding
- **result:** system design specification, accepted by the customer

Requirements should be...
- unambiguous
- complete
- verifiable
- consistent 
- maintainable
- traceable
#### Classes of Requirements

| type                                              | example                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| functional                                        | -                                                                                         |
| non-functional                                    | efficiency, reliability, portability, maintainability, quantity structure, response times |
| technical boundary conditions                     | capacities, platforms                                                                     |
| economic boundary conditions                      | budget, time to market                                                                    |
| standards (formal, industrial, de facto, de jure) | ISO, Windows compliant                                                                    |

#### Frequent Problems:
1. unrealistic objectives
2. lack of common understanding
3. inefficient collaboration
4. project plans are not accepted by project team
5. lack of management support


### Questions

#### Why is it important to have requirements that are unambiguous, complete, and verifiable?

<details> <summary>Click to show answer</summary> <p>It is important to have requirements that are unambiguous, complete, and verifiable to ensure a clear understanding of what needs to be developed. Unambiguous requirements prevent misinterpretations, complete requirements ensure that no necessary functionality is omitted, and verifiable requirements allow for checking that the implementation meets the specified needs. These qualities help in preventing scope creep, reducing the risk of project failure, and ensuring customer satisfaction.</p> </details>

#### Explain how the project motivation (business objectives) and project strategy (planned procedures, time, and budget plan) are interrelated and why they are crucial for project success.

<details> <summary>Click to show answer</summary> <p>Project motivation, or business objectives, define why the project is being undertaken and what benefits it is expected to deliver. The project strategy outlines how these objectives will be achieved through planned procedures, timeframes, and budget allocations. These elements are interrelated because the strategy provides the roadmap to achieve the motivation. Without clear business objectives, the project lacks direction; without a strategy, the project cannot effectively plan for and meet its goals. Both are crucial as they guide decision-making and resource allocation throughout the project.</p> </details>

#### **Scenario:** During the requirement analysis phase, your team discovers that the initial budget is insufficient to meet the technical boundary conditions and non-functional requirements specified by the client. How would you handle this situation, and what steps would you take to align expectations and project scope?

<details> <summary>Click to show answer</summary> <p>I would handle this situation by organizing a meeting with the client to discuss the findings. I would present a detailed analysis showing why the initial budget is insufficient and how the technical boundary conditions and non-functional requirements impact costs. Steps to align expectations might include revising the project scope, prioritizing requirements, seeking additional budget approval, or negotiating trade-offs in functionality or quality. Clear communication and collaboration with the client are essential to reach an agreement that aligns with their business objectives and constraints.</p> </details>

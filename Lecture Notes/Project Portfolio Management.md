#PMBOK #Portfolio

Project portfolio management is a centralized management of one or more portfolios, which includes identifying, prioritizing, authorizing, managing, and controlling projects, programs, and other related work, to achieve specific strategic business objectives. [[PMBOK (Project Management Book of Knowledge)]]
### Portfolio
A collection of projects, programs and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Projects and programs within a portfolio may not necessarily be related, but they are managed together to balance competing demands on resources and achieve strategic goals.

### Strategic Alignment
All projects and programs within the portfolio must align with the organizations strategic objectives. This involves prioritizing projects based on their potential impact and contribution to the organizations goals.

### Risk Management
PPM includes identifying, assessing and mitigating risks at the portfolio level. This involves balancing the risk and reward of various projects to ensure the portfolios overall risk profile aligns with the organizations risk tolerance.

## Key Processes in PPM

### Identification
Identify potential projects and programs that could be included in the portfolio. This involves gathering project proposals and ideas from various sources within the organization.

### Categorization
Grouping projects into categories based on criteria such as strategic alignment, risk, return on investment (ROI), and resource requirements. This helps in prioritizing and evaluating projects.

### Evaluation and Selection
Assessing the value, risk and feasibility of each project using quantitative and qualitative criteria. Projects are then selected based on their alignment with strategic goals and their potential to deliver value.

### Prioritization
Ranking projects based on their strategic importance, potential benefits and resource availability. High-priority projects are given preference in resource allocation and scheduling.

### Portfolio Balancing
Ensuring the portfolio is balances in terms of risk, return, and resource utilization. This involves making trade-offs and adjustments to achieve an optimal mix of projects.

### Authorization and Allocation
Approving selected projects and allocating the necessary resources. This includes assigning budgets, personnel, and other resources needed for project execution.

### Review and Adjustment
Periodically reviewing the portfolio to assess its performance and make necessary adjustments. This involves re-prioritizing projects, reallocating resources or terminating projects that no longer align with strategic objectives.

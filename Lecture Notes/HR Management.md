### Questions

#### Compare and contrast directive and supporting behaviors in team management. How can each style impact team dynamics and performance? Provide examples of when each approach might be appropriate.

<details> <summary>Click to show answer</summary> <p>Directive behavior involves strict orders and focus on team performance, which can drive productivity but may lead to reduced satisfaction among team members. Supporting behavior, on the other hand, focuses on team member satisfaction and morale, promoting a positive work environment but potentially sacrificing task completion efficiency. Examples could include using directive behavior during critical project deadlines and supporting behavior during team-building exercises.</p> </details>

### Discuss the role of Agile HR management in motivating employees through self-chosen tasks and high degrees of freedom and responsibility. How does Agile HR address the challenge of flat hierarchies in terms of career development?

<details> <summary>Click to show answer</summary> <p>Agile HR motivates employees by allowing them to choose tasks aligned with their skills and interests, providing autonomy and responsibility. This approach fosters intrinsic motivation and creativity. However, the challenge of flat hierarchies means limited vertical career advancement. Agile HR addresses this by emphasizing skill development, horizontal career growth through varied experiences, and recognition based on contributions rather than hierarchical position.</p> </details>

#WorkBreakdownStructure #WBS 

= hierarchical logical structure, that represents all the work necessary to produce the projects deliverables


**Development:**
1. Identify the projects products (What must be delivered to achieve projects success?)
2. Identify the major deliverables for projects success (--> potential milestones)
3. Incorporate additional levels of detail
4. Review and refine until stakeholders agree with level of project planning

**Components:**
- Milestones
- Deliverables
- Work Packages
- Scope
- (Dates, resources, costs, quality)

**Work Packages:**
- Responsible/acting roles
- required knowledge
- duration and effort
- deliverables
- perquisites for the Work Package
- criteria for successful acceptance
- figures to verify appropriate execution

**Approaches for the WBS:**

![[WBS.png]]

- Research projects: Organization according to phases often preferable
- Development projects: Structure according to deliverables often makes more sense

**Best practices:**
1. finish layers before turning to a lower one
2. Logical coherence & minimal branch interdependencies
3. Use hierarchical IDs for WBS elements
